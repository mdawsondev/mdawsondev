# mdawsondev - Web Developer

*Hi there!*

This repository isn't exclusive to any specific project or notes, but if you're looking to learn a bit about me then you've come to the right place. This isn't a portfolio, and it's not meant to be a pitch for employment (*although*, if you like what you see! üòâ).

This is where I house information about my skills, my workflow, project history, certification and course history, etc.; as well as providing source code to my website for anyone who want's to see what's going on under the hood.

I mainly made this to share with other developers and get feedback to help tighten my weakest areas. I also needed another place to put more emojis. ü•ûü•êü•®
