# Projects

Details about projects I've felt proud of beyond course lessons. All of these were created as personal projects that I either still maintain or have since archived in a local drive to revisit at a later date.

## Job Helmet

This was my first React project, and also something I wanted to build that would benefit myself and other developers. The idea behind Job Helmet is that it scrapes a collection of data from other sites via JSON from API calls, XML from RSS feeds, and HTML when neither of the former options are available.

## Red Soup

Red Soup is a fun project I built for somewhat silly purposes. It's main funtionality is to scrape Reddit.com in one of several ways: via a collection of subreddits, a single subreddit, or every new post in the API, and then filter the results with keywords.

This project runs locally on the user's terminal and was more of a way to catch loose Steam keys in the wild using Regex. It worked fantastically! Now I use it to scrape data based on keywords for data mining.

I intend to continue the development of this project for further experience with NodeJS and local terminal development.

## Architect

Architect was my first attempt at getting to learn NodeJS. The idea was to create a build template based on one of my old projects built in batch called Turnkey, which I used to quickly build a new project structure in my local repository folder.

The user was able to define several paramaters via `npm init` format: project name, location, etc. - then they were prompted to initalize git, create an initial commit, create a GitHub repository, and push their project to the directory via `hub`.

It was only after building this project that I learned of Yeoman and various npm build-based projects, so I haven't spent much time working on this in a while. It was a valuable learning experience, however, and I don't regret the time I spent on it. I haven't seen another project that immediately connects a new project to GitHub, so I may explore that functionality further.
